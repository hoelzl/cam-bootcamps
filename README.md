# Coding Academy Bootcamps

This repository contains fun projects that you can use to improve your
programming skills. They are intended to offer participants in courses
of the [Coding Academy Munich](https://coding-academy.com/) additional
training materials after they have completed the training, but we hope
you find them useful and enjoyable, no matter whether you have participated
in one of our courses or not.
